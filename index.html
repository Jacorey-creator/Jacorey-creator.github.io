    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Of course I am a pretty big nerd when it comes to computers however it's not just that! I love playing videogames, 
        ever since I was little platformers such as Donkey Kong Returns and Kirby Returns to Dreamland have always held a special place in my heart. 
        Also I really like writing and making stories; one of my favorite pass times is getting a group of friends together to play Dungeons & Dragons-
        of which I write the plot and story for the rest of the players to enjoy. My happy place has always been the beach and I hope to one day live in a home near the shore with my family</p>
